Fake banking app to bait people that steal your phone into giving up their info and getting themselves caught

When the theif tries to do anything in the app, a photo is taken of them and uploaded to firebase. The phones location is also periodically uploaded to firebase.

A second app at https://github.com/a-xm-yang/BaitMasterTracker is required to be installed on another phone to access this information
