Project for HackWestern 2019 by Alexander Yang and Nicholas Seniow

Fake banking app to bait people that steal your phone into giving up their info and getting themselves caught

When the theif tries to do anything in the app, a photo is taken of them and uploaded to firebase. The phones location is also periodically uploaded to firebase.

A second app at https://github.com/a-xm-yang/BaitMasterTracker is required to be installed on another phone to access this information
